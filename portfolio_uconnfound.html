      <p>
        In 2015 The UConn Alumni Association undertook a second web redesign project to coincide with their merge into the UConn Foundation. The redesign from two years prior was successful, but was starting to show itâ€™s age. The organization was in need of not only a web redesign, but full overhaul to support the widespread organizational changes that were going to take place over the coming year.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Technical limitations due to hosting difficulties had compounded over the recent years and the lack of a comprehensive content audit during the previous redesign project was reducing the effectiveness of SEO, in-site search functionality, and day-to-day maintenance. Additionally, lack of a responsive or mobile-optimized site was having a profound negative impact on user experience.
        </p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          It was clear that the first steps needed to be a full, comprehensive content and technical audit. The technical audit helped confirm our decision to migrate to a University-managed WordPress solution. The content audit, which was done side-by-side with the technical audit, consisted of not only data collected through Google Analytics, but also one-on-one interviews with staff and stakeholders. This combination of information revealed opportunities to consolidate, update, and remove outdated content. Additionally, bringing in user testing during the development phase helped identify and resolve pain points before launch, specifically within the menu and organizational structure.
        </p>
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          Launched in May 2016, the new UConn Alumni website received positive feedback almost immediately from alumni and University partners and administration. Metrics-wise we saw a modest increase in pages per session, time spent on page, and sessions from mobile devices. However, most importantly we saw a reduction in day-to-day traffic variance that created a more consistent trend in visits and sources in which traffic was directed from.
