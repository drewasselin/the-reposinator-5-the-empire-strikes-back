      <h2>Comrades: Mobile App for Tabletop Roleplaying Gamers</h2>
        <p>
          Comrades, a mobile app concept that connects local tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) players through shared interests, is the result of a semester-long project for my Interaction Design course. The project challenged me to select a local community, identify a problem or challenge being faced by that community, and develop a solution. For this project, I focused on the local tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) community. TRPGs are highly social, interactive experiences that are typically played in-person using books, maps, dice and other resources to build engaging worlds and stories for the players to interact with (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, Pathfinder, etc.) <br>

        <h2>Just Futures: Brand and Style Guide</h2>
          <p>
            Just Futures is a transdisciplinary research collaborative focusing on using research methods and data to understand and support immigrant- and refugee-run organizations in the Grand Rapids, Mich. area. My role was to design and document a brand and style guide as a milestone project for my Graphic Design course. The project included the design of a logo, primary color palette, typography, and sample photography.<br>

      <h2>UConn Alumni Association: UConnAlumni.com</h2>
        <p>
          As the UConn Alumni Association’s staff Web Designer and Developer, I was a primary contributor in the restructuring of the Alumni Association website. The website was a central location for alumni to connect, with the university and each other, through chapters, events, volunteering opportunities, career resources, and membership. The UCAA website became bogged down and unorganized due to the successful and rapid expansion of the organization. <br>

      <h2>UConn Foundation: Greatest Hits of 2016 Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          Every year the UConn Foundation organizes a Calendar Year End (CYE) campaign to encourage donations before the end of a calendar year. In the past these campaigns have focused primarily on leveraging the concluding year’s tax incentives, but the engagement had dwindled in previous years.<br>

      <h2>UConn Foundation: UConnAlumni.com</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015 The UConn Alumni Association undertook a second web redesign project to coincide with their merge into the UConn Foundation. The redesign from two years prior was successful, but was starting to show it’s age. The organization was in need of not only a web redesign, but full overhaul to support the widespread organizational changes that were going to take place over the coming year.<br>

      <h2>Presentation: How Small Shops Can Tackle Big Redesigns</h2>
        <p>
          Part of a 3-group conference panel on website redesigns, my colleague and I discussed how we approached a large web project with only 2 dedicated staff members and a $10,000 budget.
          We shared our project constraints, timeline, and results but focused mostly on the key concepts that small or large teams can use during a redesign: Technical and Content audits, Expert and Stakeholder Interviews, and Expectation and Project Management.<br>

      <h2>Contextual Inquiry: Consulting Report</h2>
        <p>
          Conducted over the course of the Fall 2018 semester, this project report was the culmination of group contextual inqury of a local non-profit entity. Using observational methodologies such as semi-structured interviews, affinity walls, and observations, our group identified opportunities for this organization to improve their internal data security proceses. Our group documented our processes, research, results, and reccomendations in a 25 page document.
