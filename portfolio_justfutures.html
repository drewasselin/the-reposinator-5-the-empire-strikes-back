      <p>
      Just Futures is a transdisciplinary research collaborative focusing on using research methods and data to understand and support immigrant- and refugee-run organizations in the Grand Rapids, Mich. area. My role was to design and document a brand and style guide as a milestone project for my Graphic Design course. The project included the design of a logo, primary color palette, typography, and sample photography.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I began this project by learning more about Just Futures. I did this through reading a provided project brief and attending a client presentation. I was able to identify some common themes such as a focus on community, advocacy, and security. I also considered the diverse cultural background of many of the partner organizations that Just Futures would be collaborating with. The branding and design of Just Futuresâ€™ assets needed to convey a sense of understanding and support in order to foster strong community relationships.
        </p>

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          Using this information as a guide, I focused my design process on creating logo concepts that used simple shapes, and avoided imagery or iconography that may not translate consistently for diverse groups. I settled on a cross-shape logo made up of four united parts that resemble four people holding hands. To support the sense of unity, I chose shades of green for the primary color palette. Finally, when considering typographic solutions, I payed close attention to the legibility of each typeface. Partners and clients may not speak English as their first language and the typography of this collaborative should not impose an additional barrier on understanding.
