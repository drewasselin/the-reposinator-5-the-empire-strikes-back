UConn Alumni Association: UConnAlumni.com

As the UConn Alumni Association’s staff Web Designer and Developer, I was a primary contributor in the restructuring of the Alumni Association website. The website was a central location for alumni to connect, with the university and each other, through chapters, events, volunteering opportunities, career resources, and membership. The UCAA website became bogged down and unorganized due to the successful and rapid expansion of the organization.

Challenges
The website’s old framework and poorly-groomed content left the alumni association with a bloated and dated experience. Even with relevant content and high visitor affinity, analytics showed low interaction and high abandonment. Visitors were confused and overwhelmed when navigating the site, so much so it was common for staff to field web-related questions from constituents. A successful solution relied on stronger organization and prioritization of content supported by a more modern framework.

Solution
A very short timeline made a full content audit impossible, but our feedback and analytics made it clear where visitors were struggling on the association’s website. Using this information I made recommendations on how we could better group the wide variety of offerings and guide visitors through context-driven sub menus and an optimized content strategy.

Additionally, I worked closely with an external design and development vendor, who had been hired prior to my involvement, to create a visual experience that supported the reimagined content and structure.

Outcomes
After the launch in June 2013, we saw steady, positive trends over the following months as more visitors stayed longer, visited more frequently, and viewed more content. We also saw a significant change in visitor habits stemming from the reorganization and clarification of the site hierarchy and menus. Staff also reported a decline in emails and phone calls with questions about where certain information might be found on the website.
