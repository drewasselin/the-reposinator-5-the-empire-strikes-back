      <h1>UConn Foundation: Greatest Hits of 2016 Campaign</h1>
    <img class="portfolio-img" src="images/port-uconnfound-greatest.jpg" alt="laptop, tablet, and iphone screens showing the landing page for the 2016 UConn Greatest hits campaign that highlights accomplishments throughout the year on vinyl records that animate when hovered over or tapped" />
      <p>
      Every year the UConn Foundation organizes a Calendar Year End (CYE) campaign to encourage donations before the end of a calendar year. In the past these campaigns have focused primarily on leveraging the concluding year’s tax incentives, but the engagement had dwindled in previous years.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          The CYE campaign is generally a broad appeal, so we needed to find a way to target relevant content to a wide, diverse audience. We also wanted to incorporate a theme to the campaign as in the past it generally was prohibitively on-brand and corporate. Additionally, because the campaign typically ran the last few weeks of the year, efforts directly competed with holiday travel and vacations. Technical limitations also played a large role. Our WordPress installation did not allow for custom scripts or Flash so our solution needed to rely on native Bootstrap or CSS functionality.
        </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          This campaign required a wide variety of content in a short period of time, so strategic repurposing of the best content throughout the year allowed us to provide a diverse offering without overcommitting our staff during an already taxing time of year. We also extended the campaign from the final two weeks of the year, to the final four weeks allowing more time for engagement before the peak of the holiday season.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary role was to design a theme and implement it within the constraints of our web property. Given the length of the campaign and the re-purposing of content, I decided that a “Greatest Hits” type countdown was a perfect theme to execute this campaign. A jukebox style was unique, relevant to the countdown theme, and could be executed in the form of dual-sided “flipping” vinyl disks through HTML/CSS. To encourage continued interest over the month, I released new stories every few days and coordinated promotion with our social media and email managers.
        </p>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          The Greatest Hits campaign had a great showing in both email and social media and resulted in one of the most successful CYE events in recent years. We specifically saw an increase in smaller donors who, historically, were unmotivated by tax-based incentives for giving.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also received a number of positive responses about the unique theme and design from our donors, alumni, and our university partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest takeaway from this project was the value in off-brand themes and the benefits of more informal design and copywriting. Historically the organization was hesitant to use less-than-formal approaches to giving. However, the success of this campaign showed that when used properly, it is an effective engagement tool.
